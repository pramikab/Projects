Dataset from Kaggle.
Build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).
The train.csv dataset contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not.
The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the passengers' survival.
Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
